{
// Atomic-park bracketing for a pointer that's being read by another
// thread (typically the audio thread) and we need to do something with
// the pointee from the message thread that mustn't overlap with the
// audio thread's use.
//
// Sequence:
//   1. Acquire-load the pointer; bail if null.
//   2. Release-store nullptr - the other thread sees null on its NEXT
//      acquire-load and bails before dereferencing.
//   3. Sleep sleepMs - covers any in-flight access on the other thread
//      that loaded the pointer just BEFORE step 2. ~25 ms is plenty
//      even for 1024-sample buffers at 44.1 kHz (~23 ms per block).
//   4. Run fn (the work that needs exclusive access).
//   5. Release-store the original pointer back so the other thread
//      resumes normal use on its next callback.
//
// Used by PluginSlot to bracket getStateInformation /
// fillInPluginDescription so the audio thread isn't inside processBlock
// on the same plugin while we're reading its state. Several plugins
// crash hard - taking down Mutter / the GNOME session - if the host
// violates JUCE's "processBlock and getStateInformation must not
// overlap" contract.
//
// Returns the parked pointer (or nullptr if it was null at entry) so
// the caller can detect the no-op case.
