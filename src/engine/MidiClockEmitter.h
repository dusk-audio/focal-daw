// Generates MIDI Clock (F8) + transport (FA / FC) bytes for a per-block
// MidiBuffer. The caller routes the buffer to a juce::MidiOutput via
// sendBlockOfMessages so delivery happens on JUCE's background thread.
// Audio-thread safe - the emitter holds only POD state and writes
// timestamped bytes into a pre-allocated MidiBuffer.
//
// Sample-accurate placement: F8 ticks fire on a monotonic sample clock
// that advances independent of the transport playhead. This means a
// stop/start round-trip preserves clock continuity (the master's clock
// doesn't restart) - downstream slaves expect that. Transport bytes
// (FA / FC) are edge-triggered on isRolling transitions.
//
// Convention: emit FA (Start) on any false -> true rolling transition.
// FB (Continue from current position) isn't differentiated in v1 -
// most masters just send FA; users with picky slaves can wire Continue
// later if needed.
