// Per-app plugin host infrastructure. Owns the AudioPluginFormatManager and
// the shared KnownPluginList (the "what's installed" cache). Channel strips
// hold their own PluginSlot which calls back here to instantiate plugins.
//
// MVP: registers JUCE's default formats (VST3 and any platform-natives that
// happen to compile in). NO automatic scan-on-startup - that's slow and
// unbounded; deferred to a later stage that runs scanning on a background
// thread with progress UI. For now, plugins are loaded by file path via
// `createPluginInstance(File)` and we add to KnownPluginList as we go so
// session save/restore can re-instantiate by description.
//
// Lifetime: a single PluginManager instance lives in AudioEngine for now
// (so the audio engine owns plugin infrastructure alongside the device
// manager). Could move to FocalApp scope later if non-engine code needs
// access.
//
// Threading: ALL methods on this class are message-thread-only. The audio
// thread never touches the manager - plugin instances live in PluginSlot
// after construction and the audio thread only reads the slot's atomic
// `currentInstance` pointer. KnownPluginList is mutated in-place by
// scanInstalledPlugins / createPluginInstance and read by
// getInstrumentDescriptions / getKnownPluginList; concurrent access from
// other threads would race. Calling any method here from the audio thread
// is a bug.
