// A single plugin slot - holds at most one AudioPluginInstance and exposes
// audio-thread-safe processing methods. Designed for per-channel use:
// channel strips own a PluginSlot and call its `processMonoBlock` between
// phase-invert and EQ in their per-block processing.
//
// Threading rules (RT-critical):
//   • load() / unload() / setEnabled() run on the message thread only.
//   • processMonoBlock() / processStereoBlock() run on the audio thread.
//   • The instance pointer is wrapped in a std::atomic so swap-in / swap-out
//     are lock-free for the audio thread. Old instances are released on the
//     message thread after the swap (the instance destructor is NOT
//     RT-safe). The audio thread sees either nullptr (no plugin → bypass)
//     or a fully-prepared instance.
//
// MVP scope:
//   • No multi-bus support - mono in / mono out, with a stereo fallback when
//     a plugin can't do mono.
//   • No editor window management - that's a follow-up stage.
//   • No state save/restore via SessionSerializer yet - also follow-up.
