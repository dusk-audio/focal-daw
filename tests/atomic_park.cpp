// withParkedAtomicPointer is the bracketing primitive that guards
// PluginSlot::getStateBase64ForSave / getDescriptionXmlForSave from
// racing the audio thread inside the plugin. Phase A of the Mutter-
// safety work moved it here so it's testable without needing a real
// plugin instance.
//
// Per the Focal test guidelines (no threads / no sleeps / one concept
// per TEST_CASE), the contract is verified by inspecting the slot from
// inside the work lambda: while the lambda runs, an atomic load on the
// slot returns nullptr - which is exactly the property the audio
// thread observes when its own acquire-load lands during the parked
// window. The cross-thread visibility of release/acquire ordering is a
// language-spec property we don't need to re-test here.
